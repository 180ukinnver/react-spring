# useSpring

```js
import { useSpring, animated } from 'react-spring'

// Update props by overwrite
const props = useSpring(config)
// Or, update props by calling an updater-function
const [props, set] = useSpring(() => config)
```

## Interpolation

* colors (names, rgb, rgba, hsl, hsla, gradients)
* absolute lengths (cm, mm, in, px, pt, pc)
* relative lengths (em, ex, ch, rem, vw, vh, vmin, vmax, %)
* angles (deg, rad, grad, turn)
* flex and grid units (fr, etc)
* all HTML attributes
* SVG paths (as long as the number of points matches, otherwise use [custom interpolation](https://codesandbox.io/embed/lwpkp46om))
* arrays
* string patterns (transform, border, boxShadow, etc)
* auto is valid
* non-animatable string values (visibility, pointerEvents, etc)
* scrollTop/scrollLeft ([native only](/perf), since these aren't actual dom properties)

<br />

Of course the only properties that the browser can animate relatively cheaply are [composite properties](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/high-performance-animations/) (opacity, transform), so you might want to watch out for that.

## Config

<p>
  <span className="highlight">Spring are configurable</span>, delays, tension, friction, resets, everything can be tuned. There are also a couple of generic presets that will cover some common ground.
</p>

```jsx
import { Spring, config } from 'react-spring'

<Spring config={config.default} />
````

| Property                  | Value |
| ------------------------- | ------- |
| config.default             | { tension: 170, friction: 26 } |
| config.gentle              | { tension: 120, friction: 14 } |
| config.wobbly              | { tension: 180, friction: 12 } |
| config.stiff               | { tension: 210, friction: 20 } |
| config.slow                | { tension: 280, friction: 60 } |
| config.molasses            | { tension: 280, friction: 120 } |

## Properties

bla

| Property | Type | Description |
| -------- | ---- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| from     | obj | Base values, optional |
| to       | obj/fn/array(obj) | Animates to ... |
| delay     | number/fn | Delay in ms before the animation starts. Also valid as a function for individual keys: key => delay |
| immediate     | bool/fn | Prevents animation if true. Also valid as a function for individual keys: key => immediate |
| config     | obj/fn | Spring config (contains mass, tension, friction, etc). Also valid as a function for individual keys: key => config |
| reset     | bool | The spring starts to animate from scratch (from -> to) if set true |
| reverse     | bool | "from" and "to" are switched if set true, this will only make sense in combination with the "reset" flag |
| onStart     | fn | Callback when the animation starts to animate |
| onRest     | fn | Callback when the animation comes to a still-stand |
| onFrame     | fn | Frame by frame callback, first argument passed is the animated value |
