# useChain

```js
import { useChain, animated } from 'react-spring'
```

useSprings manages multiple springs. Use it whenever you have an arry of values that you want to animate (static lists, etc). It behaves exactly like [useSpring](/useSpring) with the distinction that you supply a count as the first argument, while the spring config is given for each item, either functionally, or as an array. 

### Either: overwrite values to change the animation

If you re-render the component with changed props, the animation will update.

```jsx
const springs = useSprings(items.length, items.map(item => ({ opacity: item.opacity }))
```

### Or: pass a function that returns values, and update using "set"

You will get a `set(Values)` function back, use it to update the animation. This will not cause the component to render, which can be generally more performant. It also prevents configs from being re-created on every render. Handling updates like this is extremely useful for fast-occurring updates, like event streams, mousemoves, etc.

```jsx
const [springs, set] = useSprings(items.length, index => ({ opacity: items[index].opacity }))
// ...
set(index => ({ opacity: items[index].opacity }))
```

### Finally: distribute animated props among the view

The return value is an array containing animated props.

```jsx
return springs.map(item => <animated.div style={props} />)
```
